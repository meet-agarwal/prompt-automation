Section 5: Gallery (Cross-Selling)  

 Objective:  
Display 10 related product cards in a horizontally scrolling, auto-sliding gallery with a uniform layout.  

 Requirements:  
1. Card Layout:  
   - Image (90% height): Square-shaped (1:1 aspect ratio), covering the top 90% of the card.  
   - Button (10% height): A "View" button at the bottom, spanning the full width.  
   - Overall Card: Uniform size for all cards with consistent spacing.  

2. Gallery Behavior:  
   - Auto-Slide Scroll:  
     - Infinite, smooth, continuous horizontal scrolling.  
     - Pauses on hover (user interaction).  
   - CSS-Only Implementation:  
     - Must use `@keyframes` for animation (no JavaScript).  
     - Smooth, seamless looping effect.  

3. Image Links:  
${image links}$

4. Item Links :
${item links}$

4. Technical Implementation Notes:  
   - Use `display: flex` for the card container.  
   - Apply `@keyframes` with `transform: translateX()` for smooth scrolling.  
   - Ensure hover pauses the animation (`animation-play-state: paused`).  
   - Optimize for responsiveness (works on different screen sizes).  
   - there will be duplicate gallery so that we can perciver the infinite scrolling effect 
   - let each cards width be 15rem
