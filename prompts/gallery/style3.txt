Objective:  
Display 9 related product cards in a static 3-row × 3-column grid with uniform sizing and direct image links.  

Requirements:  

1. Grid Layout:  
   - Structure: 3 rows × 3 columns (total 9 cards).  
   - Image Dimensions:  
     - Square (1:1 aspect ratio).  
     - All images must be equal in size (same width/height).  
   - Spacing: Consistent gaps between cards (CSS `gap` property).  

2. No Animation/Scrolling:  
   - Static grid (no auto-sliding, `@keyframes`, or `transform: translateX`).  

3. Image Links:  
   - Each image is directly clickable (wrapped in `<a>` tag).  
   - Use the following URLs:  
     ```plaintext
     Product 1: https://listingbot.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/resources/images/shullee/product_1.jpeg  
     Product 2: https://listingbot.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/resources/images/shullee/product_2.jpeg  
     Product 3: https://listingbot.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/resources/images/shullee/product_3.jpeg  
     Product 4: https://listingbot.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/resources/images/shullee/product_4.jpeg  
     Product 5: https://listingbot.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/resources/images/shullee/product_5.jpeg  
     Product 6: https://listingbot.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/resources/images/shullee/product_6.jpeg  
     Product 7: https://listingbot.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/resources/images/shullee/product_7.jpeg  
     Product 8: https://listingbot.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/resources/images/shullee/product_8.jpeg  
	 Product 9: https://listingbot.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/resources/images/shullee/product_9.jpeg 
     ```  
   (Note: Only 9 products needed for 3x3 grid; adjust if more are required.)  

4. Technical Implementation:  
   - Use CSS Grid (`display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr)`) for the layout.  
   - Ensure equal image sizing (e.g., `width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 1/1; object-fit: cover`).  
   - Responsive: Scales cleanly on all screen sizes (use relative units like `%` or `fr`).  
   - No buttons—images are the sole clickable elements.   
   - Subtle hover effect (e.g., slight opacity change) if interactivity is desired later.  
   - all the cards must have the border and the border shadows 
   - add small padding to each cards 
   - let each cards width be 15rem
