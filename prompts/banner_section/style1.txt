Section 2: Infinite Auto‑Sliding Banner Carousel

Objective:
Create a responsive, contained‑width, infinitely looping image carousel with auto‑sliding and manual navigation controls using pure CSS.

Requirements:

Place the banner slider immediately below the header, constrained to the same maximum content width as the rest of the page (e.g. 1200px) and centered.

Display 4 images (all 1280×290 px) in a continuous, infinite auto‑sliding loop.

Smoothly transition between slides with no “jump” at the loop point.

Use only CSS (no JavaScript), via one of these methods:
• Radio buttons + :checked selectors
• CSS @keyframes animation with infinite looping (duplicate slides if needed)
• CSS transform/translate techniques

Technical Specifications:

Image Aspect Ratio: All banners are 1280×290 (≈4.41:1). Maintain that ratio:
• If container width is 1200px, height = (290/1280) × 1200 ≈ 272px.
• Enforce height: auto; max-height: 400px; so very wide screens don’t over‑tall the carousel.

Container:
• .carousel-container {
max-width: 1200px;
margin: 0 auto;
overflow: hidden;
}
• .carousel-container img {
width: 100%;
height: auto;
display: block;
}

Auto‑Advance: Advance every 3s with a smooth 0.8s ease‑in‑out transition.

Looping: Seamless infinite loop—duplicate first and last slides in your markup (or via CSS) to avoid gaps.

Navigation & Accessibility:
• Use hidden <input type="radio"> elements and <label> arrows for manual controls.
• Add aria-label="Previous slide" / aria-label="Next slide".
• Pause animation when any control or slide receives focus.

Performance:
• Apply will-change: transform to the sliding track.
• Use loading="lazy" on images if supported.

Implementation Notes:  
- Wrap the carousel in a `<div class="carousel-container">` which shares your page’s max‑width and horizontal centering rules.  
- Inside, hide overflow and size the inner slider to fit exactly four slides’ widths.  
- Duplicate the first and last slides in markup or via CSS `:nth-child()` cloning to achieve a seamless loop.  
- Use CSS `@media` queries to adjust height/aspect ratio on smaller viewports.  
- Include meaningful `alt` text for each `<img>`.  
- the banners should not be visible in the mobile View
