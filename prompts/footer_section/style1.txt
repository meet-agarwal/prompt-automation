Newsletter Signup (CSS‑only): A simple <label> + <input type="email"> + <button> styled to look like a link (“Subscribe for 10% off”).

Thank‑You Message: Short line: “Thanks for supporting [YourStoreName]!”

Use CSS Grid with two rows: first row for links and icons side‑by‑side, second for newsletter and thank‑you.
